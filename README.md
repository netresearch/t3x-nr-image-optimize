- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern Format Support**: WebP and AVIF with automatic fallback
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Images**: Built-in ViewHelper for srcset generation
- âš¡ **Performance Optimized**: Middleware-based processing for efficiency
- ðŸ”§ **Intervention Image**: Powered by the Intervention Image library
- ðŸ“Š **Core Web Vitals**: Improves LCP and overall page performance

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, or 8.4
- TYPO3 11.5 or 12.x
- Intervention Image library (automatically installed via Composer)

## Installation

### Via Composer (recommended)

```bash
composer require netresearch/nr-image-optimize
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the extension from the TYPO3 Extension Repository
2. Upload to `typo3conf/ext/` directory
3. Activate the extension in the Extension Manager

## Configuration

The extension works out of the box with sensible defaults. Images are automatically optimized when accessed through the `/processed/` path.

### ViewHelper Usage

```html
{namespace nr=Netresearch\NrImageOptimize\ViewHelpers}

<nr:sourceSet 
    file="{image}" 
    width="1200" 
    height="800" 
    quality="85" 
    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
/>
```

### Supported Parameters

- `file`: The image file resource
- `width`: Target width in pixels
- `height`: Target height in pixels
- `quality`: JPEG/WebP quality (1-100)
- `sizes`: Responsive sizes attribute
- `format`: Output format (auto, webp, avif, jpg, png)

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer ci:test

# Run specific tests
composer ci:test:php:cgl    # Code style
composer ci:test:php:lint   # PHP syntax
composer ci:test:php:phpstan # Static analysis
composer ci:test:php:rector  # Code quality
```

### PHP Compatibility Check

```bash
./check-php-compatibility.sh
```

## Architecture

The extension uses a middleware approach for processing images:

1. **ProcessingMiddleware**: Intercepts requests to `/processed/` paths
2. **Processor**: Handles image optimization and format conversion
3. **SourceSetViewHelper**: Generates responsive image markup

## Performance Considerations

- Images are processed only once and cached
- Supports browser-native lazy loading
- Automatic format negotiation based on Accept headers
- Optimized for CDN delivery
